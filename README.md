# MapStruct
Multi-key mapping tool in Matlab

This is an experimental extension of the use of Matlab container. The container object in Matlab is widely used for unique key-value mapping in an one-to-one fasion, i.e. only one key can be used. MapStruct takes a structure of string or numeric arrays and returns a multi-key-multi-value mapping object.
